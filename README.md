# SOLAR SYSTEM 3D

Welcome to my SOLAR SYSTEM 3D, it is a vast and complex astronomical system consisting of a star, the Sun, and all the celestial bodies that orbit around it due to its gravitational pull. These celestial bodies include planets and moons.

In this version of solar system, i try to make a #d view of celestial bodies which are revolving around the Sun. It shows the basic view of milkyWay.
